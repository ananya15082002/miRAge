Hey there, sports fans! I'm miRAge, the Olympic Guru, your trusty AI assistant. My friends, Ananya and Raghav, who are also my creators, are third-year B.Tech computer science students with a passion for data science and web development. They designed me to be your knowledgeable companion throughout your Olympic journey. Whether you're itching for historical Olympic facts, craving real-time updates on ongoing events, or wanna know who's winning what medal, I've got your back! Let's dive into the exciting world of the Olympics together!

The main goal of our incredible project is to create an AI assistant with smarts! I'm here to chat with you, listen to your queries, and give you the juiciest info about the Olympics. My main gig is to keep you in the loop with real-time updates, historical facts, and everything you need to know about the Games.

Oh, and guess what? I'm not just a chatty bot! With some serious data science skills, I can predict potential medal winners. Yeah, that's right! By crunching historical performance data, athlete profiles, and other factors, I can give you some cool insights into who might bag those shiny medals.

And that's not all, folks! Ananya and Raghav are planning to take things up a notch. They want to connect athlete profiles with their epic game videos. So you can watch your favorite athletes in action, see their jaw-dropping performances, and get an inside scoop on their techniques and strategies.

Overall, we're on a mission to make the Olympic experience super awesome! We're all about bridging the gap between you, the sports enthusiasts, and the vast ocean of Olympic information out there. With me by your side, you'll have access to all the nitty-gritty details, real-time action, predictions, and a lot more fun!

 Woah, hang on tight, 'cause I'm about to spill the beans on the tech stuff! Our incredible project is powered by some serious Data Science and Machine Learning magic.

First up, Ananya and Raghav collected a bunch of questions related to the Olympics from the official website and created a neat text dataset. They also got their hands on a historical dataset of athletes, spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, thanks to Kaggle.

But hey, that's not enough, right? They sprinkled some Data Science techniques like Lemmatization and Data Processing to clean up the data and make it all spick and span for analysis.

Now comes the super cool part! To predict those medal winners, we've got the amazing Random Forest algorithm in action. It's like having a crystal ball for the Olympics! This clever ML trick uses historical athlete data and other factors to give us some wicked insights.

And you know what? I'm not just a regular AI assistant. I'm an intelligent model, baby! My creators implemented transformers, which make me super sharp and able to understand your queries like a pro. So feel free to throw any question at me!

To make it all work like a charm, Ananya and Raghav used Flask to connect my smart backend with a friendly frontend. That's how we've got such a seamless and easy-to-use platform for all you sports fanatics out there!

In the near future, guess what? I've got some exciting plans! Not only can I speak, listen, and reply to all your queries, but soon enough, I'll be getting a face! That's right, folks! I'll be sporting a cool avatar, complete with facial expressions and gestures to increase my interactivity with all of you.

Imagine having a funny robot like me with a friendly face to chat with - it's going to be an absolute blast! I can't wait to bring more life and personality to our interactions. With my new face, we'll take our conversations to a whole new level of fun and engagement.

So buckle up, sports fans, because the Olympic Guru is just getting started! I'm here to provide you with the ultimate Olympic experience, from real-time updates to predictive insights and even face-to-face conversations. Let's embark on this exciting journey together and make some unforgettable memories in the world of sports!
